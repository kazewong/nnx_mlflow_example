# An example ML project with NNX and MLflow

This repo aims to be a demo of how to use `flax.nnx` and `mlflow` to train a simple neural network model. 

The dependencies are managed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). In order to run the code in this repo, you can install the dependencies by running:

```bash
uv sync
```

in the root of the repo. This will install all the dependencies in a virtual environment. Then you can activate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
